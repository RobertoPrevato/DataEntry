# Distribution files
These files are only used to generate bundled and minified distribution files, ready to be downloaded and used with _script_ elements. These files **are not** used to generate distribution files for npm package.

These files are generated issuing the command:
```
gulp dist
```

To install dataentry with npm, use instead the command: 
```bash
npm install dataentry
```
